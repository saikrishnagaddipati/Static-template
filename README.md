# Static-template
Static template which renders data from the js/framework
This template doesn't have any editable functionalities. Items are displayed by passing the items from config.
The template consists of ten items per page which are automatically rendered from js file.
In horizontal view the template divides automatically into two parts. First part displays five items and the second part displays the remaining five items.
In vertical view the page displays all the ten items. 
Bootstrap is used for the above functionality.
currently this template is set to handle 40 items, but infinite number of items can be added in js file. 
Each page is displayed for five seconds. 
Cycle repeat is set to default value 2.
This template is configured to work on 1920x1080 and 1080x1920 monitors. 
Css styling is necessary if you want to use it for different monitors.
